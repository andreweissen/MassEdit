'''MassEdit''' is a task automation and bulk editing tool written in ES5-compliant JavaScript. Its development was inspired by a desire to make the bulk editing capabilities of dedicated bot software like [[w:User blog:RansomTime/An Introduction to AutoWikiBrowser|AutoWikiBrowser]] and [[w:User blog:RansomTime/An introduction to Pywikipediabot|Pywikibot]] and the in-editor capabilities of FindAndReplace more readily available to the average contributor.

Run as an in-browser application, MassEdit provides users with the ability to automate otherwise tedious editing and upkeep tasks. It can create a new set of pages/templates/categories, add or remove content from existing pages, categorize or recategorize pages in bulk, find-and-replace select content from pages at will, message users, generate lists of member pages belonging to categories or namespaces, or generate listings of pages transcluding certain templates. In addition to providing a listing of loose pages, users may also input the names of [[mw:Help:Categories|categories]] or [[mw:Help:Namespaces|namespaces]] to edit their respective member pages in bulk.

As of its most recent updates, the script employs a number of other external dependencies similarly housed on Dev. In addition to those loaded by default in MediaWiki, MassEdit makes use of [[Modal|Modal.js]], [[Placement|Placement.js]], [[I18n-js]], [[Colors|Colors.js]], and [[WgMessageWallsExist]] for the purposes of standardizing modal design and providing more comprehensive [[wikipedia:Internationalization and localization|i18n]] support. Due to the potential for abuse in the form of vandalism or spam, the application can only be used by high-level local staff (i.e. admins, moderators, and bots) and assorted global groups.

== Installation ==
{{Script Install
| codepage = MassEdit/code.js
}}

== Configuration ==
Certain elements of the MassEdit script may be configured to its users' liking via the inclusion of a <code>window</code> variable named <code>window.MassEditConfig</code>. Though users are free to adjust the interval at which the script edits pages, rates faster than the limits imposed on users and bots will be adjusted to the internal maximum intervals of 1500 ms for users and 750 ms for bots. Users may also modify the default placement of the "MassEdit" button used to open the modal and begin use of the script. As this script supports all of [[Placement|Placement.js's]] approved element locations, users may list any supported placement location as MassEdit's default button location; see Placement's approved locations for details.

An example config object is displayed below:
<syntaxhighlight lang="JavaScript">
window.MassEditConfig = {
  interval: 2500,
  placement: {
    element: "toolbar",
    type: "append"
  }
};
</syntaxhighlight>

{| width="100%" class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"

|-
|}

== General usage ==
In addition to the standard usage of the "prepend" and "append" options to edit content of existing pages, these options may be used interchangeably to create a set of new pages based on the inputted values of the pages text area. Selecting either option and inputting page titles of nonexistent pages creates these pages automatically, allowing for a quick and efficient means of publishing new articles from a template or text extract.

Furthermore, though the find-and-replace function may be used as intended to locate and replace wikitext, HTML, or plaintext from existing articles, it may also be used to remove content from pages. Leaving the "New Content" field blank is counted as an empty string, allowing for the removal of the content of the "Target Content" field from the articles in question.

Users are also provided with the ability to edit/delete/replace content from pages in a set of inputted categories. Selecting the "Categories" dropdown option and including the names of the categories in the textarea edits all extant pages currently in the category. (Note: Category titles may be included as <tt>Category:Example Category</tt> or simply as <tt>Example Category</tt>.)

In addition to the above category-based editing, users may also edit pages belonging to certain legitimate namespaces, separating individual namespace numbers (<tt>0</tt> for main namespace, <tt>4</tt> for Project namespace, etc.) by line breaks, as per standard usage instructions.

Users may also use the listing generation functionality to collate listings of pages transcluding selected templates. As with categories and namespaces, multiple embedded templates may be included as input on separate lines, with all duplicate entries making use of several input templates removed prior to sorting and display.
